I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Technology, Operations, and Statistics](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/tops) at the Stern School of Business, New York University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Xi Chen](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~xchen3/), Professor [Elynn Chen](https://elynncc.github.io/), and Professor [Jeffrey Simonoff](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/). Before joining Stern, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, where I was advised by Professor [Xiangzhong Fang](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/People/corecher/fxz_20180710175435673424/1279074.htm) and Professor [Xiaohua Zhou](https://faculty.washington.edu/azhou/).

My research lies at the intersection of **statistical methodology**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven decision-making**. I am particularly interested in developing statistical estimation and inference frameworks for analyzing **heterogeneous data** arising from multiple different sources. This includes advancing methods in **distributed learning**, **transfer learning**, and **reinforcement learning**, with a focus on addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity and task discrepancy. I am also engaged in research on **tensor decomposition**, **multi-armed bandit algorithms**, **longitudinal data analysis**, and **tree-based models**, improving computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees in high-dimensional or structured settings.
